        <p id="intro-paragraph">
            Hello, My name is Enrique aka Weeetuesday. These are some of the photos of me that i feel like stand out the most.<br> 
            when taking these and selecting them  i feel like it shows a part of me that is self-conscious of how I see my self.<br> 
            These are some of my favortie pictures that i have taken trough my phone.

            <h2 id="article-1-heading">A GOOOD POSE FOR THE PICTURE!</h2>
            <p id="blue-shirt-paragraph">This is one of my first photos i have been fully comfortable and prepared for<br>
            since i was attending a wedding i had to get my hair combed up and styled.<br>
            I usually dont do my hair its always the same from  the beginning of the morning till the end.

        <h2>AWESOME GLASSES</h2> 
            <p>This is a selfie i took at american eagle <br> i wanted to put on here since i dont want to have a full serious portfolio<br>
            some comedy in this page is always good.<br>i really enjoy these types of pictures becaause i wear glasses for these past 7-8 years.<br> 
            i dont use shades nor have any at home so when we are out in the store <br> i like to try some on just to see how i would look with them.

        <h2>LIKE MOM SAID NO FAVORITES!</h2>
                <p>This by far is one of my favorites since we where already having a proffesional photographer take our photos.<br>
                I decided to start taking some of my own just because the lighting was great; The place my wife chose was great<br>
                These type of photo is a good way to get my self out of my comfort zone. I persoanlly deal with body dysmorphia <br>
                which is why i never really took pictures of my self.

        <h2 id="article-4-title">A GOOOOOD SELFIE NEVER HURT ANYONE!</h2>
            <p id="article-4-paragraph" >this was also at the same place as the picture before, but why add two photos of the same time and place?<br> 
            these are honeslty one of my top pictures i have added to my website portfolio. I feel like they are expressing me. <br> 
            My pirecings are also showing and i like my piercings HAHA-nervous laugh.<br>i have some snake eyes but i didnt like any of the ones i had taken that had my tongue piercing in.
