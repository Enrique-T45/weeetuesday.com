# Author: Enrique â€” Weeetuesday

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! This is the **first website I've ever published**, and Iâ€™m proud to share it. If you have any ideas on how to make it better, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™m always open to feedback and learning.

Iâ€™ve been working on this for about **4 days**, diving into layout, styling, and storytelling. Itâ€™s my first time using **Flexbox** and experimenting with **text styling**, so this project is a big step in my creative and technical journey.

## ðŸ§  Learning Journey

This project helped me:

- Get a hands-on understanding of how **Flexbox** works for layout control
- Start using **semantic HTML** to structure content meaningfully
- Explore how design choices affect storytelling and user experience

If you spot anything off or have suggestions for improvement, Iâ€™d genuinely appreciate it. Iâ€™m here to grow, iterate, and keep building better things.
